 # Prettier Ignore
 #
 # - Ignore JS
 # - Ignore Styles
 #
 # == WHY ==
 #
 # The reason this file exists is becacuse we DON'T
 # use Prettier, so this is going to make sure any
 # extensions or commands ran on this theme do NOT
 # format files, as we use eslint and stylelint's --fix
 # option.
 #
 # We do, though, have prettier installed and use it for format all other
 # types of files (that it does a good job with). It mostly integrates into
 # husky, but if you run prettier on files, this will ensure it only
 # runs on the types of files we want.
 #
 # - Ignore some misc files too

# We don't want Prettier auto-formatting JS files, use eslint --fix.
**/*.js
**/*.jsx
**/*.ts
**/*.tsx
**/*.vue

# We don't want Prettier auto-formatting Styles, use styleint --fix.
**/*.scss
**/*.css

**/*.php # Also keep your hands off PHP, even though we don't really have an autoformatter.
**/*.html # Don't touch HTML files either.
**/*.xml # You don't do XML, but I've seen you try as HTML.

# Don't touch lib directories.
**/.git*/**
**/node_modules/**
**/vendor/**

# ...but for everything else, go for it, we don't really have opinions about those.
