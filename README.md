Hi. I'm a starter theme called `wd_s`, or `wdunderscores`. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead, try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for!

I feature some of the web's most proven technologies like: [Tailwind](https://www.tailwindcss.com), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss). To help you write clean code (that meets [WordPress standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/)), we tap into [@wordpress/scripts](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/packages/packages-scripts/) for linting CSS and JavaScript. Did I mention that I'm also accessible? Yup. I pass both WCAG 2.1AA and Section 508 standards out of the box.

I also support [Selective Refresh](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/03/22/implementing-selective-refresh-support-for-widgets/) and [Live Preview](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API#Part_3:_Configure_Live_Preview_.28Optional.29) in the Theme Customizer.

Looking to use some of our custom Gutenberg blocks? It's easy! Add the [WDS Blocks](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wds-blocks) plugin for a quick starter including our Accordion and Carousel bloocks.

Looking to use some of our Advanced Custom Fields Gutenberg Blocks? It's also easy! Add the [WDS ACF Blocks](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wds-acf-blocks) plugin for a whole set of blocks built with ACF including: Accordion, Carousel, Call To Action, Fifty/Fifty, Hero, Recent Posts, and Related Posts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Because I compile and bundle assets via npm scripts, basic knowledge of the command line and the following dependencies are required: [Node](https://nodejs.org) (v12+) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

### Quick Start

If you want to keep it simple, head over to [https://wdunderscores.com](https://wdunderscores.com) and generate your `wd_s` based theme from there. You just input the name of the theme you want to create, click the "Generate" button, and you get your ready-to-awesomize starter theme.

### Advanced

If you want to set me up manually:

1. [Download](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s/archive/master.zip) and extract the zip into your `wp-content/themes` directory and rename `wd_s-master` to fit your needs.

2. Find & Replace

You'll need to change all instances of the names: `_s`.

- Search for: `'_s'` and replace with: `'project-name'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain
- Search for: `_s_` and replace with: `project-name_` to capture all the function names
- Search for: `Text Domain: _s` and replace with: `Text Domain: project-name` in style.css
- Search for (and include the leading space): <code>&nbsp;\_s</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Project Name</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks
- Search for: `_s-` and replace with: `project-name-` to capture prefixed handles
- Search for `_s.pot` and replace with: `project-name.pot` to capture translation files
- Search for `_s.test` and replace with: `project-name.test` to match your local development URL
- Edit the theme information in the header of style.scss to meet your needs

## Installation

1. From the command line, change directories to your new theme directory:

```bash
cd /wp-content/themes/your-theme
```

2. Install theme dependencies and trigger an initial build:

```bash
npm i
```

### NPM Scripts

From the command line, type any of the following to perform an action:

`npm run build` - Compile and build all assets.

`npm run start` - Automatically handle changes to CSS, JS, SVGs, and image sprites.
